CHANGELOG - Version 2.1.2
-------------------------

Doxygen: New feature
	Added doxygen documentation of main simulator classes in pdf and html formats

Dashborad: New features
	Info signs are introduced to provide description of charts and certain values
	Fixed captions in a number of charts.

main.tcl: bugfix
	Fixed link capacity between rack and aggregation switches from 1 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s

run.sh: update
	Changed default scheduler from Green to HEROS  

CHANGELOG - Version 2.1.0
-------------------------

run.sh: parameters
	The run script accept parameters for easier customization of simulations.
	Please execute ./run -h for their list
	Parameters should have form -parameter=value

clouduser.h (and others): task response time measurements
	The task response time are being measured. Due to the resulting scanning of packet,
	tasks' output communication is serialized (no channel sharing)

dcscheduler directory: schedulers are implemented as classes
	Schedulers are implemented as classes, they can be selected as a parameter of a simulation

powermodels directory: new power models
	New power models for full system and per component power models.
	
herosscheduler: new scheduler
	HEROS scheduler is a new scheduler, presented at IEEE CLOUD 2015 conference in the following paper:
	HEROS: Energy-Efficient Load Balancing for Heterogeneous Data Centers
	Mateusz Guzek, Dzmitry Kliazovich, Pascal Bouvry 
	Available upon request at: http://hdl.handle.net/10993/21417

topology.tcl and dc.tcl: new heterogeneous topologies
	New heterogeneous data center configurations are available, in which servers have different 
	capabilities and have different power functions. The new topologies names are:
	"three-tier heterogenous debug" and "three-tier heterogenous". 
	They are described in HEROS paper (see above).
	
percomponentmodel.h: new power model
	The new power model enables to estimate power consumption as the sum of the consumption 
	of the dcresources of a server. The consumption of dcresources is estimated as as any power model.
	
corescheduler.cc: bugfix
	Remove completed task function corrected.

vmmigration.cc: bugfix
	Missing argument in line 133 added. This could cause crashes of simulator on some platforms. 
	
taskoutsink.cc: bugfix 
	After successful communication the host energy counter is updated to flush 
	communication counter and enable entering host into sleep mode (addition in line 48)
	
corescheduler.cc: bugfix
	Change of comparison  with  deadline instead of comparison with execution time (line 280)

CHANGELOG - Version 2.0.2
-------------------------

vmmigration.cc: Bugfix
    The communication agents of VMs are not properly re-attached after migration. 

CHANGELOG - Version 2.0.1
-------------------------

install_local.sh: New instalation script
    The script can be used to install GreenCloud without root previliges. 
	In such case, it should be run instead of install.sh
	
64-bit compatilibility: improvements
	The GreenCloud can be now directly used on 64-bit installations. 
	The changes inculded solving old implementation of pointer-casting.

DNS on servers: funcitonality restored
   	According to users request, the functionality
   	
CHANGELOG - Version 2.0.0
-------------------------

Detailed description of servers resources: New features
    Host resources are now divided into types. 
	The resource types are used during allocation and power modeling.
	Hosts are assembled from components, that provides resources.
	The predefined types are: Computing, Memory, Storage, Networking.
	Memory and Storage utilization are static, while Compiuting and Networking are dynamic (based on cpu scheduler or ns-2 networkign layer).
	Heterogenous hosts: each host specification is separetely and independently defined.   
	
Virtualization: New features
	A new layer of virtualization is available.
	VM are intermediary between Hosts and Tasks.
	A new abstractions are created: ResourceConsumer and ResourceProvider.
	Tasks are ResourceConsumers, Hosts are ResourceProviders, VMs are both ResourceConsumers and ResourceProviders.
	Tasks can be allocated on any ResourceProvider.
	There can be arbitrary number of nested VMs.
	VM dynamic migration is enabled.
	Load of a Host is computed recursively, taking into account the virtualization.
	
Power models: New features
	The power models are now described by separate class.
	Two sample models are presented: a simple model used in GreenCloud 1 and low power blade.
	
Multi-core processors: New features
	Multi-core processors and multi-processors systems are supported.
	The processors can be assymteric (e.g cores may have different speeds and architectures)
	The scheduling is performed per-core.
	Tasks can be multi-threaded, i.e. have multiple computing demands. In such case they can be allocated in a valid (i.e. not violaiting constraints) ways on a single core or multpile cores ( possibly on different CPUs) of a single host. 
	
Dashborad: New features
	Dashboard presents now plots for tasks and load of VMs.
	Dashboard presents statistics for tasks rejected on data center scheduler and tasks failed on host level. 
	
Tcl scripts: Improvements
	user.tcl	- All user-related deifitions and behavior was moved to this file
	dc.tcl		- The data center capacity is dynamically calculated basing on the declated hosts capacities.
				- Simple static virtualization section that creates a single VM per host is added.
