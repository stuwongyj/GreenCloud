Q: How can I use the support of Virtual Machine migration supported by the GreenCloud Simulator. 

A: You can begin experiments with migration by uncommenting the code in the end of the dc.tcl script:

# puts "Testing VM migration..."
# $ns at 1.0 "$DCenter migrate-vm $vms_(0) $hosts_(4)"
# puts â€œMigration initialized correctly"

Which starts migration of vm id 0 to host 4 at second 1 of simulation time.

You must ensure that enough resources are available on the migration target machine.

This tcl code is being processed by DataCenter object via command function, so you can also trigger migration directly in C++ code.
